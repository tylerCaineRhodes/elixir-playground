<h1>Wildthings Refuge</h1>

<blockquote>
  When we comtemplate the whole globe as aone great dewdrop, striped and dotted
  with continents and islands, flying through space with other stars all singing
  and shining together as one, the whole universe appears as an infinite storm
  of beauty.
  -- John Muir
